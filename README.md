A robot that is like the RC Jumper in Watch Dogs 2

Updated... Need to debug or rewrite the UART code to make it work...

In the video above, you can find that there are several functions for the jumpers to achieve:
* Compact
* Wi-Fi Controlled (I have thought about Bluetooth and Wireless signal, but they have very short transmitting distance and low-security level)
* "Tank" moving
* Jumping (with "enhanced spring", it can jump over a wall)
* Rotation-free web camera
* Middle-Man network
* Robot arms
* Automatic recognizing the 3D position

There are more functions that it has:
* Items dropping (unlikely to be considered this time!)
* Broadcasting some sound (Maybe included)
